"delete_dupes" searches for and deletes duplicate files. 

By default, it searches through a single folder and creates a list of that folder's contents. Then it searches
through the rest of your home directory and deletes any duplicate files it discovers.

delete_dupes now includes options that allow you to directly compare two directories (for if you want to use this with script
for external hard drives or diectories that do nt exist in your main directory), or search through a single directory for any
duplicate files it may contain.

delete_dupes is meant to be used with bash 4.x and above. If you should discover any bugs, please report them to me at
